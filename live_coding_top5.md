[comment]: # (Consider adding screenshots for each of these tips)

## Tip 1: Customize your Azure Portal

* Disable your toasts
* Change your theme
  * DOUBLE CLICK TO CHANGE THEME -> Wrong theme? Don’t panic. Double click.
  * High contrast options available
* Customize your dashboard

    [comment]: # (You know you can pin your resources to the dashboard, but…)

  * Pin new & cool things to the dashboard (quickstart, clock)
  * Resize them, rearrange them – just like win10 start menu

* Subscription filter

    [comment]: # (you have multiple subscriptions, don’t want everyone to see your personal resources. Those are the ones I’m making Satya pay for.)

* Cloud shell is your friend.
  * Azure CLI 2.0 is installed
  * Use bash or PowerShell.
  * Change the text size
  * Open in a new window
  * Drag & drop files – easy to upload into your VM or other Azure resource
  * Check VM status – MOST foolproof way to do it

## Tip 2: Show your users how to save $

* VM Autoshutdown feature
* Delete resource groups

## Tip 3: Make the code easy to read

* Zoom in properly! (ctrl + wheel or ctrl + =/-)
* Zen mode in VSCode
* Fonts and colors

## Tip4: Use code snippets

* VSCode extension for this
* Carefully choose your snippet size: large is fine for boilerplate, but use small, incremental snippets for anything your audience shoudl follow

## Tip5: Use keyboard shortcuts (appropriately)

* Tips & tricks section and keyboard shortcuts section within VSCode!
Command palatte (ctrl + shift + p)
keyboard shortcuts ?
alt + up/down moves a line of code up or down
